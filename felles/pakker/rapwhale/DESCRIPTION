Description: An ensemble of functions that are necessary or potentially useful
    in the creation of statistical reports for medical quality registries. Includes
    functions for creating graphs and tables, which keep the same arguments used
    for most tables and graphs, can apply confidence intervals, and include utiities
    for improving graphs. Other functions are developed to accomodate European file
    formats, Norwegian grammar, and the standard format for medical reports, in addition
    to commands usable in LaTex.
